      <h3>hi!</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Liam! My pronouns are they/she/he (default to they) and I’m a High School junior in the <abbr title="College and Carreer Promise">CCP</abbr> Dual Enrollment program. 
        This is my first year here, and I am currently enrolled in 2 <abbr title="Advanced Placement">AP</abbr> classes, and 3 <abbr title="Central Piedmont Community College">CPCC</abbr> classes this semester. 
        I love working with computers and I have a passion for coding, math, making music, art, games, computers, and robots. 
        I also co-captain a robotics team, <abbr title="First Tech Challenge">FTC</abbr> #16461, Infinite Turtles- seamlessly working with others while also mentoring newer members. 
        I also designed the current arm of the robot on my team.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Personal Background:</b> 
          I started my life in Southern California before moving to Charlotte. <br>As of writing this, I am 17 years old. (I was born in 2008)</li>
        <li><b>Professional Background:</b> 
          Former <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Intern at Little Diversified 
          (Maintained and repaired employee hardware and prepped computers for donation to E2D. 
          Also handled some tickets.), 
          Continued Collins Aerospace Partnership to manufacture custom additive titanium parts for my robotics 
          team, volunteered at the Matthews Alive Festival and at a Discovery Place Booth (both also for my team). 
          Also founded and mentored another robotics team (<abbr title="First Tech Challenge">FTC</abbr> #24078) for 2 years.</li>
        <li><b>Academic Background:</b> Current Dual Enrollment here at CPCC/STEM-focused homeschool program, including classes in upper-level math and science. Successful completion of AP CSA. GPA 4.3. ITE JS certificate program completion scheduled Spring 2026 and Associates in Science scheduled Spring 2027.</li>
        <li><b>Primary Computer:</b> Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 9 7040 Series) with Discrete AMD Radeon RX 7700S GPU. OS is Arch Linux with Hyprland, waybar, swww, eww, wofi, (etc…), and custom configs (though I also dual-boot with Windows 11). Primary working location is my desk at home, though I set up anywhere.</li>
        <li><b>Courses I’m Taking, & Why:</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>MAT271 - Calculus I:</b> I am taking this because it's required, and I also love math.</li>
            <li><b>ACA112 - College Transfer Success:</b> A required course to get me used to CPCC</li>
            <li><b>ENG111 - Writing and Inquiry:</b> Also required, but writing is also super important. (I’m writing right now!)</li>
            <li><b>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting (this class!):</b> Because I want to improve and optimize my web-building skills.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</b> I actually am (update: was!) on vacation at a Lake Michigan beach while I’m doing college, which I think is pretty funny.</li>
        <li><b>I’d Also Like to Share:</b> I built an 8-bit computer from the ground up! I prototyped, made schematics, designed and laid out a PCB, got it made, assembled it, programmed an “OS” and some simple games and test programs. I also made changes to a FAT32 SD card library for the CPU I am using on this (6502), and added file creation/writing! (previously not supported)</li>
