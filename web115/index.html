        I am a creative computer scientist/inventor and visionary. I have a passion for coding, math, making music, art, games, computers, and robots. I also co-captain a robotics team, FTC 16461, Infinite Turtles- seamlessly working with others while also mentoring newer members. I also designed the current arm of the robot on my team.
